            <h2 class="subheading">History</h2>
            <p>The idea of a specialist hospital in Jigawa State was initiated in 1998 by the then Military Administrator of the State Lt. Col. Rasheed Shekoni Alade. However, this laudable project was abandoned by the subsequent regimes until the coming of Governor Sule Lamido (Con) who completed and rehabilitated the structure in 2007. It was equipped with modern and state-of-the-art facilities necessary for diagnostic and curative needs of our people. In order to harness the utilities of these equipment, to the benefit of the people, the present administration employed 550 various health professionals to render their expertise to the populace in this hospital. The hospital with 220 beds capacity was officially commissioned on 17th March 2011, by His Excellency Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan (GCFR), the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as the first specialist hospital in the state. This was a laudable and historical achievement to the people of Jigawa State.</p>
